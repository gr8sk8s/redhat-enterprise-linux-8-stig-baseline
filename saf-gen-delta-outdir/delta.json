This is used to set extended attributes on a file.\n\"Lsetxattr\" is a system call used to set an extended attribute value. This is used to set extended attributes on a symbolic link.\n\"Removexattr\" is a system call that removes extended attributes.\n\"Fremovexattr\" is a system call that removes extended attributes. This is used for removal of extended attributes from a file.\n\"Lremovexattr\" is a system call that removes extended attributes. This is used for removal of extended attributes from symbolic links.\n\nWhen a user logs on, the AUID is set to the UID of the account that is being authenticated. Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to \"-1\". The AUID representation is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals \"4294967295\". The audit system interprets \"-1\", \"4294967295\", and \"unset\" in the same way.\n\nThe system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts each syscall made by all programs on the system. Therefore, it is very important to use syscall rules only when absolutely necessary since these affect performance. The more rules, the bigger the performance hit. The performance can be helped, however, by combining syscalls into one rule whenever possible.\n\n",

Password complexity, or strength, is a\nmeasure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing\nand brute-force attacks.\n\n    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it\ntakes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the\nnumber of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is\ncompromised.\n\n    RHEL 8 utilizes \"pwquality\" as a mechanism to enforce password\ncomplexity. Note that to require special characters without degrading the\n\"minlen\" value, the credit value must be expressed as a negative number in\n\"/etc/security/pwquality.conf\".",
